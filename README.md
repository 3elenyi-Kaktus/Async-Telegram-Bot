# miniHeadHunter Telegram Bot

### This is an asynchronous Telegram bot, representing small part of features, available on popular websites, like HH.ru and similar ones.

Currently, this bot maintains several available methods.

**Globally, you can:**

* Firstly, register
* Change your settings
* Change your personal info
	
**As a Worker, you can:**

* Post your CV's
* Look for available offers
* Submit your CV's to offers

**As a Hirer, you can:**

* Post your offers
* Get answers on your offers from Workers

`/sudo` can be used to add some start offers to work with.

When a Worker submits his CV, the Hirer gets a notification with info
about the employee and his personal tag to contact him. The database
is online: when Hirer leaves (or changes his role to a Worker), his
offers are automatically deleted.
